Dynamic Recursive Point Pattern Matching Algorithm for CBIR
MK-RoD : Recursive Point Pattern Similarity Measure Algorithm (Matched Keypoints' Ratio of Distances)

This dynamic recursive algorithm is designed for Content Based Image Retrieval systems.

MK-RoD stands for Matched Keypoints' Ratio of Distances and it is a recursive and dynamic point pattern similarity measure algorithm which works in conjunction with Keypoint Generation algorithms

For demonstration purposes, this program recognizes ASL input(query) images by comparing it with the database images and outputs the equivalent ASCII representation of it.

Keypoint Features are generated by using SIFT.

The details are given inside the zip file on separate explanatory algorithm diagrams and every .m file is documented in detail.
Open the 'Readme.txt' in order to learn how to execute the program.
