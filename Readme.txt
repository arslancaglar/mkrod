"American Sign Language (ASL) Interpretation Using Hand Gesture Recognition"
Authors: Caglar Arslan and Okan Cilingiroglu
----------------------------------------------------------------
Development History:
Algorithm Design : 02 May 2006 by Caglar Arslan
Implementation: 20 May 2006 by Caglar Arslan and Okan Cilingiroglu
Optimization : 24 May 2006 by Okan Cilingiroglu and Caglar Arslan
Documentation : 25 May 2006 by Caglar Arslan and Okan Cilingiroglu
Revision #1 : 17 February 2011 by Caglar Arslan

NOTES:
1) For the details of the algorithm investigate the following images:
-AlgorithmOverall.jpg
-MKRoDAlgorithm.jpg
2) The prototype is implemented on MATLAB 7.0 and revised in MATLAB 7.10.0
3) The backgrounds of input images have to be purely ‘black’ and the details of the content(palms, fingers) must be clear for accurate recognition of the ASL.
4) A reduced ASL dataset is used. The dataset contains the following ASL gestures: "b,c,h,i,o,l,y".

Use 'execHGR.m' inside the 'Project' folder in order to execute the program.

I hope you will enjoy it. ;)
